Attestations establish trust and credibility by enabling issuers to make claims, either onchain or offchain, about any quality about the recipient's wallet address. 


## EAS Attestations

Coinbase Verfications leverages the [Ethereum Attestation Service](https://attest.org/) (EAS), an open-source base layer for making attestations. Attestations are issued on Base using EAS with ENS domain [verifications.coinbase.eth](https://app.ens.domains/verifications.coinbase.eth). 

This technology, paired with a credible issuer, can transfer credibility to the recipient. Because the attestation can be stored onchain, anyone can gather the attestation data from EAS.


## Schemas

Schemas act as blueprints for attestations and define the structure and type of data for a specific type of attestation. They set the information requirements for the attestation to contain.

| Schema name          | Schema content           | Schema ID |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | --------- |
| Account Verification | bool verifiedAccount     | `0xf8b05c79f090979bf4a80270aba232dff11a10d9ca55c4f88de95317970f0de9` |
